## Watch 12 Films

1. Flight Risk - 25th January 2025
Went to a movie screening with Kate for Flight Risk featuring Mark Wahlberg, the trailer gave the impression that it could be a film that could probably be wrapped up in 30minutes, and after seeing the film I think I stand by that position.  The film had a simple premise and some questionable aspects that were added for artistic licence... for example (spoiler) the air traffic control at the end helping land the plane saying goodbye you're on your own just as they get to above the runway was laughable, and yes, with zero information about how to do the landing what happens next is pretty predictable.  Was nice to go out, and nice to go to a cinema in London with Kate and was nice to get a free glass of wine!  Three 🛩️🛩️🛩️ out of five.

2. Nosferatu - 31st January 2025
Very self indulgent trip to the Rex in Berkhamsted on my own for a Friday matinee of this film.  I had a nice time going to the cinema for this film, had a coffee and a bag of minstrals and sat at a table for four on my own on the lower level.  Annoyingly I didn't think through the parking situation and gave myself anxiety throughout the film about getting back and finding I'd got a parking ticket.  After a day or so, I was able to reflect on the film and found I thought it was actually quite good.  The camera work was really good and atmospheric and I enjoyed the characters, the husband who was trying to do what he thought was the right thing but ended up being pretty much useless, the demon who was just doing demon stuff and had to respond to an incantation from the other side of the world and the girl who did something many years ago which had unintended consequences far out reaching what she thought it would be... all things I could draw parallels to!  A little too much animal head biting off for my delicate constitution but enjoyable all in all.  I give it Four 📦📦📦📦 boxes of dirt out of five.
